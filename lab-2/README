# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Lab
This lab provides hands-on experience in creating and configuring an Amazon VPC using the AWS CLI. The goal is to build a secure and scalable network infrastructure in AWS by setting up a VPC, subnets, routing, security groups, and launching an application server.

# Key Tasks Covered:

# AWS CLI Setup:
Access the AWS environment and configure AWS CLI with credentials.

# Creating a VPC:
Set up a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
Enable DNS hostnames for better network management.

# Subnet Creation:
Create both Public and Private Subnets.
Enable auto-assign Public IP for the public subnet.

# Internet Gateway Configuration:
Create and attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC for external access.

# Route Table Configuration:
Create a Public Route Table and associate it with the public subnet.
Add a route to the Internet Gateway for internet access.

# Security Group Setup:
Create a Security Group to allow HTTP (port 80) traffic.

# Launching an Application Server:
Deploy an EC2 instance in the public subnet.
Use a user-data script to configure and install a web application.
Retrieve the public DNS to validate the setup.

# Learning Outcomes:
✅ Gain hands-on experience in AWS networking.
✅ Understand VPC components like subnets, route tables, and gateways.
✅ Configure security groups for controlled access.
✅ Deploy an EC2 instance and configure a web application.
